<p>Otherside is where the impossible happens. With the power of Improbable’s M2 technology, 10,000+ players will be able to interact simultaneously in a single place, connect with natural voice chat (even in crowds of thousands), experience rich, immersive gameplay supported by AI and physics, and move between metaverses. Otherside players will break through barriers in scale, bandwidth, and rendering as they create new types of gameplay and social possibilities.</p>
<p>Just like processing power in your PC can limit the quality of a game’s graphics, metaverses are limited in their scale by how many communication operations or ‘ops’ per second they can process. Typical online game worlds can handle around 10,000 operations per second. Otherside will be able to handle more than half a billion operations per second, which will power new gameplay and interactions never before possible at an unprecedented scale.

It’ll also solve problems in bandwidth and rendering, using machine learning to allow huge crowds to all look different, allowing you and everybody else to bring your own external NFT character to Otherside.
