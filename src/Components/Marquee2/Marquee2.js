Build on the Otherside, collect resources, create and play on it, and make yourself at home. Otherside will be what you make it, and your Otherdeed will be your key.</p>
<p>Your Otherdeed enables you to claim a plot of land when Otherside launches</p>
<p>There will be a total of 200,000 Otherdeeds. The first 100,000 Otherdeeds are available on April 30, 2022. The second 100,000 Otherdeeds will be exclusively rewarded to Voyagers who hold Otherdeeds and contribute to the development of Otherside.</p>
<p>For those with Bored Apes or Mutants, your Otherdeed awaits your claim. For all other adventurers, Otherdeeds will be available for sale with ApeCoin.</p>
